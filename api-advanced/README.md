- Print the titles of the top 10 hot posts
- List all hot posts recursively
- Count occurrences of specific words in post titles

## Technologies Used
- Python3
- Requests library
- Reddit public API

## How to run
Each Python script can be run from the command line with the subreddit name as an argument.

Example:
```bash
./0-subs.py <subreddit>
